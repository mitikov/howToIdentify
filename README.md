# Use-case
Although the [Sitecore Contact.Identify](https://doc.sitecore.com/developers/82/sitecore-experience-platform/en/identifying-contacts.html) looks simple, it turns into a painpoint once things do not work as expected.

It much looks you've done all right, but still cannot make the API get working.
It drives you nuts as all it does is silently returns not leaving you a change to understand what is wrong there...

## Enriched API to trigger Sitecore xDB contact identification

The goal of the project is to provide a sample API that would log the identification flow and would allow you to get to the issue source sooner.
